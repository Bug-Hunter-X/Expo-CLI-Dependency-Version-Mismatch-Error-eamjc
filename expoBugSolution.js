The solution involves a combination of cleaning your project's dependencies and resolving any conflicts.

1. **Clean Installation:** Remove the `node_modules` folder (and optionally `package-lock.json` or `yarn.lock`) and then run `npm install` or `yarn install` again.

2. **Version Resolution:** If the problem persists, inspect your `package.json` for dependency conflicts.  Look for libraries with version ranges that might overlap or conflict. Try to specify more precise versions (e.g., using `1.2.3` instead of `^1.2.0`).

3. **Update Expo CLI:**  Run `expo upgrade` to ensure you are using the latest version of the Expo CLI.

4. **Check for typos:** Double-check your `package.json` for any typos in dependency names or version numbers.

Example of resolving a conflict in `package.json`:

```json
// Incorrect: conflicting ranges
{"dependencies": {
  "react-native-maps": "^1.3.0",
  "another-library": "^2.0.0" // Conflicts with react-native-maps
}}

// Corrected: using specific versions
{"dependencies": {
  "react-native-maps": "1.3.2",
  "another-library": "2.1.0"
}}
```
By following these steps and ensuring consistency between your `package.json` and the actual installed versions, you can resolve the dependency mismatch errors.
