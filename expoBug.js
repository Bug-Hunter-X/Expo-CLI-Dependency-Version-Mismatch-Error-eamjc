This error typically occurs when there's a mismatch between the dependencies specified in your project's `package.json` and the versions actually installed in your `node_modules` folder.  It can also happen if there are inconsistencies or conflicts between different dependency versions.

Example scenario (simplified):

Your `package.json` states you need `react-native-maps@1.3.0`, but `npm install` or `yarn install` (or a similar Expo command) somehow installed `react-native-maps@1.2.0`. Expo's build process then detects this discrepancy and throws the error.

Another possibility is that a dependency in your project depends on a specific range of versions of another library, and these ranges conflict (e.g., one library needs version A >= 1.0 and another needs version A < 1.0).
